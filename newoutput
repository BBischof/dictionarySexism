 Steven Spielberg's career has been famously schizoid. On the one hand, he has made films borne aloft by <em class="qword">exuberant juvenility (the 
ndiana Jones pictures, Jurassic Park, and so forth); on the other hand, he has made mature films of serious intent (The Color Purple, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan). And … there is also a third hand: he has combined those two types, most notably in Close 
ncounters of the Third Kind, in which he transmuted a fascinating science fiction film into near-theology. —Stanley Kauffmann,

 Kermeen cites “a book published in 1882” that says of ghosts at the Myrtles: “The lights are never extinguished at the plantation.

That suggests it was probably unknown until relatively recently. —Joe
