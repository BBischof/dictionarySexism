In the past people deliberately lied, or they unconsciously colored what they wrote, or they struggled after the truth, well knowing that they must make many mistakes; but in each case they believed that ‘the facts’ existed and were more or less discoverable. —Leon Wieseltier, New Republic, 17 Feb. 2003 BEGIN The information experts say that it's dangerous to conclude very much from talking to people because you will never interact with a scientifically selected random sample.
